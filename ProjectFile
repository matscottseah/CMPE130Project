TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR.
HOW I WONDER WHAT                          YOU ARE.
UP ABOVE                          THE WORLD SO HIGH.
LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE SKY.
TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR.
HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE.

WHEN THE BLAZING SUN IS GONE.
WHEN HE NOTHING                 SHINES UPON.
THEN YOU SHOW YOUR LITTLE LIGHT
TWINKLE,                                                    TWINKLE, ALL THE NIGHT.
TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR.
HOW I                                               WONDER WHAT YOU ARE.
